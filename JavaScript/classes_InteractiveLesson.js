/*
Way to go! Let's review what you learned.

Classes are templates for objects.
Javascript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.
Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.
We use the extends keyword to create a subclass.
The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.
Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.
In completing this lesson, you've taken one step closer to writing efficient, production-level JavaScript. 
Good luck as you continue to develop your skills and move into intermediate-level concepts.
